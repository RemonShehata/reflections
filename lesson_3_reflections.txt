When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to share my repository public or if there is another developer working with me on the same project. also it's a good idea to save my projects on GitHub rather than my local machine, files on my machine could be lost or corrupted for any reason. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because some changes on the remote might not work properly with the files on my local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used to copy a repository on GitHub. clone is used to copy a repository from GitHub or from local respository to my local repository. branch is used to expermient with a new feature or fixing a bug. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can fetch a copy and work offline without needing access to GitHub.
