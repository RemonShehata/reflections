When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to share my repository public or if there is another developer working with me on the same project. also it's a good idea to save my projects on GitHub rather than my local machine, files on my machine could be lost or corrupted for any reason. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because some changes on the remote might not work properly with the files on my local repository. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used to copy a repository on GitHub. clone is used to copy a repository from GitHub or from local respository to my local repository. branch is used to expermient with a new feature or fixing a bug. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can fetch a copy and work offline without needing access to GitHub.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Github I could collaberate using Google drive, but it  will be extremly hard especially with big projects. it's much easier on Github to collaborate and I can get pull requests, review them and merge them if they are OK.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    One case would be that I am not sure that the new feature or new edit is going to work, so I can work on a seperate branch and when I am perfectly sure that it works I can merge it with the master. so I can keep my master branch working at all times. another case would be when I am making a pull request I don't want to merge the pull request into master without reviewing it first.
